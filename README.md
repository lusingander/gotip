## About

gotip is a TUI application for interactively selecting and running Go tests.

Key features:

- Fuzzy filtering of test cases
- Detection of subtest names defined via table-driven tests (partial support)
- Run individual subtests or grouped subtests
- View and re-run tests from execution history

## Installation

```
go install github.com/lusingander/gotip/cmd/gotip@latest
```

## Usage

### Basic usage

In a directory containing a `go.mod` file, run:

```
gotip
```

While a test is selected, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run it using `go test`.

### Passing additional arguments

You can pass extra flags directly to `go test` by appending them after `--`:

```
gotip -- -v -count=1
```

### Running a parent test group

While a test is selected, press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to move up to its parent test group.

This allows you to execute all subtests under that group.  
For example, if you have `TestFoo/Bar/Baz` selected, pressing <kbd>Backspace</kbd> will select `TestFoo/Bar`, and running it will execute all tests under that prefix.

If subtest names could not be automatically discovered, gotip defaults to selecting the nearest available parent test.

### Using test history

Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch to History view.

In this view, you can select and run tests from your previous execution history, just like in the regular view.

The history data is stored under `.local/state/gotip/history/`.

### Rerunning the last test

You can rerun the last executed test without showing the UI by using the `--rerun` option:

```
gotip --rerun
```

This will immediately execute the most recent test from your history.

### Options

```
Usage:
  gotip [OPTIONS]

Application Options:
  -v, --view=[all|history]   Default view (default: all)
  -f, --filter=[fuzzy|exact] Default filter type (default: fuzzy)
  -r, --rerun                Rerun the last test without showing the UI
  -V, --version              Print version

Help Options:
  -h, --help                 Show this help message
```

### Config

gotip supports both global and project-specific configuration.

- Global config
  - Place your global config at `~/.config/gotip/gotip.toml`. This applies to all projects.
- Project config
  - Place a `gotip.toml` file in your current working directory. This applies only to the current project.

If both global and project configs exist, they are merged.  
For overlapping keys, the project config takes precedence.

The format is as follows:

```toml
# Specifies the command used to run tests.
# If omitted, the default command is used.
# type: list of strings
command = []

[history]
# Limits the number of test executions to keep in history.
# type: integer
limit = 100
# Format used to display timestamps in the history view.
# Uses Go's time format syntax.
# type: string
date_format = "2006-01-02 15:04:05"
```

#### `command`

The `command` field allows you to customize how tests are executed.

You can use this to always pass specific flags or use an external test runner instead of the default.

For example, to use [gotestsum](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum), you can configure it like this:

```toml
command = ["gotestsum", "--format", "testname", "--", "-run", "${name}", "${package}"]
```

`${name}` and `${package}` are placeholders that will be replaced at runtime with the selected test name pattern and package name, respectively.

If not specified, the following default command is used:

```toml
command = ["go", "test", "-run", "${name}", "${package}"]
```
